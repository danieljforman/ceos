# Scorecard Metrics

## {{company_name}}

*The 5-15 numbers that tell you the health of your business at a glance. Review weekly.*

## How to Use

Each metric has an **owner**, a **goal**, and **green/red thresholds**. During the weekly L10, each owner reports their number. If it's green, move on. If it's red, drop it to the Issues List.

## Adding Metrics

Good metrics are:
- **Owned** by one person (not shared)
- **Measurable** with a specific number (not subjective)
- **Leading** indicators when possible (activity, not just results)
- **Weekly** cadence for most (monthly for some)

Keep it to 5-15 total. If you have more, you're tracking too much.
