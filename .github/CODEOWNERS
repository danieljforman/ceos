# CODEOWNERS — CEOS
#
# This file auto-assigns reviewers to Pull Requests.
# See: https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners
#
# Note: CODEOWNERS only works for PRs from branches in the same repository.
# For PRs from forks (the typical open-source workflow), the repository owner
# reviews manually. This is expected behavior.

# Brad reviews all changes
